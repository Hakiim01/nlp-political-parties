We will not use Vader since it can only work with english languge.
    - we would need to translate the text first.#

We wwill continoue with Bert German

adding date month and year and export into a scv file

pip install germansentiment

why the neutral is zero in the compund = to map it to zero.

calculating varianze in the sentiments of individal sentences to maybe show how much chaos is in the speech.
compund sentiment
compound variance

While the compound score summarizes the overall sentiment direction (e.g., positive vs. negative), the compound variance can tell you:

üîç How consistent the sentiment is across the speech.

Low variance ‚Üí sentiment is steady (e.g., always neutral or consistently positive)

High variance ‚Üí sentiment fluctuates (e.g., some parts positive, others negative)

we are using the auto tokenizer from the model

‚ùó Avoid These:
‚ùå Lowercasing (already handled if needed)

‚ùå Stopword removal

‚ùå Lemmatization or stemming

‚ùå Removing punctuation

Those steps would distort the context that BERT relies on for meaning.

- we take 2020 - 2022
